### About the assignment
###### I did encounter some difficulties during coding but fortunately it turned out to be great!
* haven't been using JavaScript for so long and forgot so many syntaxes
* didn't think of a way to clear the existing boxes out
* Leon told me a trick that I never thought of when using innerHTML and that is so convenient!
